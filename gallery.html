Despite its size, it is highly venomous, capable of killing humans in minutes. There is no antidote. It is about 5 to 8 inches long and lives in the intertidal zone. It is bright blue, with 10 to 20 bright blue rings on its body. When it is aggravated or touched, it lights up. The prey catches small shrimp and crabs, which are too slow for the blue-ringed octopus. The octopus injects them with poison, which turns the victims into a mushy mass of food. This is a tiny, venomous head, venomous, and dangerous to small crabs."><img src="Images/image1.jpg" alt=""></div>

      <div class="slide" data-img="Images/Jelly Fish.jpg" data-desc="Jellyfish are free-swimming marine animals consisting of a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles. The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion and highly efficient locomotion. Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. Scyphozoans are the most common and recognizable jellyfish, typically found in coastal waters worldwide."><img src="Images/Jelly Fish.jpg" alt=""></div>

      <div class="slide" data-img="Images/coral reef.jpg" data-desc="Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. These structures are primarily built by coral polyps, tiny animals that live in colonies. Coral reefs are important for biodiversity, providing habitat for numerous marine organisms. They are found in warm, shallow waters and are often referred to as the rainforests of the sea."><img src="Images/coral reef.jpg" alt=""></div>

      <div class="slide" data-img="Images/Kelp forest.jpg" data-desc="Kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp, which are large brown algae. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. Kelp forests are found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters in temperate and polar coastal oceans.

They typically have a central disc and five arms, though some species have more. Starfish are found in all of the world's oceans, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and Southern Ocean.

                It is caused by inadequate waste disposal and recycling, as well as plastic products that are designed to be disposable.
                Plastic pollution is widespread in oceans, rivers, and terrestrial environments, where it poses a threat to marine life, birds, and other animals.
                Plastic debris can entangle marine animals, such as turtles and seals, and be mistaken for food by fish and seabirds.
                It can also leach harmful chemicals into the environment and contribute to global warming."><img src="Images/Plastic Polution2.jpg" alt=""></div>

      <div class="slide" data-img="Images/Pollutionbackground.jpg" data-desc="Overfishing is the depletion of fish stocks in the world's oceans due to excessive fishing. It is a serious environmental issue that threatens marine ecosystems and food security.
                Overfishing occurs when fish are caught faster than they can reproduce, leading to population declines and even species extinction.
                It is driven by industrial fishing practices, such as trawling and longlining, as well as illegal and unregulated fishing.
                Overfishing can have cascading effects on marine food webs, affecting predators, prey, and other species.
                Sustainable fishing practices, such as catch limits and marine protected areas, are essential for reducing overfishing and protecting marine biodiversity."><img src="Images/Pollutionbackground.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <div class="slide" data-img="Images/OceanCleanup.jpg" data-desc="The Ocean Cleanup is a nonprofit organization developing advanced technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic pollution.
                It was founded in 2013 by Boyan Slat, who was inspired to take action after diving in Greece and finding more plastic bags than fish.
                The organization's mission is to clean up 90% of ocean plastic pollution by 2040. It is developing passive cleanup systems that use ocean currents to concentrate and capture plastic debris.
                The Ocean Cleanup has conducted successful pilot tests and is now scaling up its operations to deploy larger cleanup systems in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other ocean gyres."><img src="Images/OceanCleanup.jpg" alt=""></div>
